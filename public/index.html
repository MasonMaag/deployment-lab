    <p>Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective, with players freely roaming its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include combat featuring several types of weapons and magic spells, horseback riding, summons, and crafting. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its open world gameplay, fantasy setting, and evolution of the Souls games, a related series by FromSoftware sharing the same core gameplay. Elden Ring sold more than 13.4 million copies within five weeks of its release.</p>
